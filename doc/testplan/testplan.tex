\section{Introduction} % VS

\subsection{Background}

This document describes the battery of tests the Mashbot product will
be required to pass in order to be considered successful. Mashbot is a
tool for managing advertising campaigns and collecting data from
social networks. It is described in detail in the Software
Requirements Specification for Mashbot.

\subsection{Structure of Document}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Section 2 - Describes the overall approach to the Acceptance
    Test Plan
  \item Section 3 - Describes in more detail features covered
    or not covered by the Acceptance Test Plan
  \item Section 4 - Describes the criteria which must be satisfied to
    begin and complete the Acceptance Test Plan
  \item Section 5 - Describes the roles and responsibilities of the
    staff members involved in the Acceptance Test plan and procedures for
    reporting test results and testing problems
  \item Section 6 - Describes the actual test cases in the Acceptance
    Test Plan
\end{itemize}

\item Functional Requirements - Functional Requirements define the internal workings of the software.
\item Unit Tests - A procedure in the software to validate that individual modules and other units of source
  code are working properly
\item Integration Test - Integration Test is a test phase which is employed after the Unit Tests are validated
  and tests how all the different modules of a software system fit and work together with each other.
\item System Test - System Test is conducted after Integration Test has been conducted to evaluate the
  system’s compliance with its specified requirements

\section{Test Approach and Restraints} % VS

\subsection{Introduction}

This section describes the overall approach, techniques and
testing tools to be used in Acceptance Test Plan for
the Mashbot and any constraints that may apply.

\subsection{Test Objectives}

The Acceptance Test Plan process will examine Mashbot and verify
whether it fulfills the requirements set forth in the Software
Requirements Specification.


\subsection{Test Structure}

The Acceptance Test Plan will consist of a subset of test cases and
methods, previously used in the Unit Tests, Integration Test and
System Test for Mashbot. The test cases will be carefully selected to
allow for the verification of the functional requirements of Mashbot
as listed in the Software Requirements Document. It is essential that
all appropriate Unit Tests, Integration Tests and System Tests were
successfully performed on Mashbot prior to the Acceptance Tests
and their results were reported and presented to the client.
