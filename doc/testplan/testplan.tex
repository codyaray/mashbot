\section{Introduction} % VS

\subsection{Background}

This document describes the battery of tests Mashbot will be required
to pass in order to be considered successful. Mashbot is a tool for
managing advertising campaigns and collecting data from social
networks. It is described in detail in the Software Requirements
Specification for Mashbot.

\subsection{Structure of Document}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Section 2 - Describes the overall approach to the Acceptance
    Test Plan
  \item Section 3 - Describes in more detail features covered
    or not covered by the Acceptance Test Plan
  \item Section 4 - Describes the criteria which must be satisfied to
    begin and complete the Acceptance Test Plan
  \item Section 5 - Describes the roles and responsibilities of the
    staff members involved in the Acceptance Test plan and procedures for
    reporting test results and testing problems
  \item Section 6 - Describes the actual test cases in the Acceptance
    Test Plan
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Approach and Restraints} % VS

\subsection{Introduction}

This section describes the overall approach, techniques and
testing tools to be used in Acceptance Test Plan for Mashbot and any constraints that may apply.

\subsection{Test Objectives}

The Acceptance Test Plan will examine Mashbot and verify
whether it fulfills the requirements set forth in the Software
Requirements Specification.


\subsection{Test Structure}

The Acceptance Test Plan will consist of a subset of test cases and
methods, previously used in the Unit Tests, Integration Tests and
System Tests for Mashbot. The test cases will be carefully selected to
allow for the verification of the functional requirements of Mashbot
as listed in the Software Requirements Document. It is essential that
all appropriate Unit Tests, Integration Tests and System Tests were
successfully performed prior to the Acceptance Tests.

\section{Test Assumptions and Exclusions} % ND

\subsection{Introduction}

This section describes details about which aspects of Mashbot are
within the scope of this Acceptance Test Plan and which are not.

\subsection{Assumptions}

The Acceptance Test Plan covers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Functional requirements of Mashbot listed in the Software
Requirements Specification
\item Usability of Mashbot
\item Consistency of user documentation for Mashbot
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exclusions}

The Acceptance Test Plan does not cover:

\begin{itemize}
\item Non-functional requirements of Mashbot besides usability, as listed in
the Software Requirements Specification
\item Quality of code
\end{itemize}

\section{Entry and Exit Criteria} % AG


\subsection{Introduction}
	This section specifies criteria that must be met in order for the Acceptance 
	Test Plan to be executed. Additionally, it specifies the criteria that must 
	be met for success and failure of the Acceptance Test Plan.
\subsection{Entry Criteria}
	The Acceptance Test Plan can be executed when these preconditions are met:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mashbot has successfully passed testing including:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Integration Testing
				\item Systems Testing
				\item Unit Testing
			\end{itemize}
		\item A testing environment has been setup which reflects the system 
		requirements as stated in our Software Requirements Specification.
		\item Copies of the latest versions of both the Software Requirements 
		Specification and other user-related documentation has been received.
		\item The latest released version of Mashbot has been received.
		\item Consent of the following people to begin the Acceptance Test Plan 
		has been given:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Project Leader
				\item Test Team Leader
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exit Criteria}
	A run of the Acceptance Test Plan has several possible outcomes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Success: All \textbf{Priority 1} requirements were tested and 
		performed as required.
		\item Failure:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item At least one of our \textbf{Priority 1} requirement 
				deviated from expected behavior.
				\item The Acceptance Test Plan was rescheduled on approval from 
				the Test Team Leader.
			\end{itemize}
		
	\end{itemize}
	

\section{Testing Participants} % ND

\subsection{Introduction}

This section describes the roles and responsibilities of people involved in the
Acceptance Test Plan, as well as how to report results.

\subsection{Roles and Responsibilities}

\begin{description}
\item[Test Team Leader] George D'Andrea
\item[User Representative] A member of the Drexel College of Engineering
faculty or the advisor to this project who will overview the testing process
\item[Tester] A person who will execute the tests
\end{description}

\subsection{Training Requirements}

Everyone involved with the test process should be familiar with Mashbot, its
user interace, the documentation, and the Software Requirements Specification.

\subsection{Problem Reporting}

Any problems discovered must be reported to the Test Team Leader, then
eventually the project Administrative Lead, to be fixed.

\subsection{Progress Reporting}

Following the test procedure, the Test Team Leader will compile a report to
submit to the Administrative Lead.

\section{Testing Project Test Cases}

\subsection{Introduction} % AG
	The test cases are divided into sections covering parts of the functionality and use cases in the Software Requirements Specification. Each test case has the following format:
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Name - The name of the test case
	  \item Preconditions - Conditions needed to initiate the test case
	  \item Actions - The actions expected from a tester
	  \item Post conditions - The expected outcome of the test
            case. If this occurs, the test succeeds. If the post
            condition is not satisfied, the test fails.
	\end{itemize}
