\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
This document provides the high level testing requirements for the Mashbot Campaign Manager and Publishing and Aggregation Platforms.  These tests will be implemented as behavioral tests that will be automatically run every time a feature is added to prevent regression.

\subsection{Definitions and Acronyms}

\section{Approach and Constraints}
\subsection{Objectives}
To assure integrity of the overall structure of the Mashbot Campaign Manager and Publishing and Aggregation Platform.
\subsection{Structure}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item External APIs are not to be relied upon for testing, so these content sources will have to be mocked out for integration testing purposes.
\end{itemize}
\section{Assumptions and Exclusions}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item External APIs are assumed to have 100\% uptime
\item Each individual tests assume the rest of the service is working properly
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item There will be no testing of External API calls, as they are assumed to be working.
\end{itemize}
\section{Entry and Exit Criteria}
\subsection{Entry Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item All lower level tests pass, including behavioral tests, and unit tests.
\item The hardware meets the specifications outlined in the Requirements Document.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exit Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All top priority tests pass | success
  \item One top priority test fails | failure
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing Participants}
\subsection{Roles and Responsibilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Campaign Manager Test Lead: Josiah Kiehl
\item Publishing and Aggregation Platform Test Lead: Andrew Gall
\item Testers: Josiah Kiehl, Andrew Gall, Cody Ray, Vito Salerno, Nick D'Andrea
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Requirements}
Testers should have general familiarity with the Campaign Manager and Publishing and Aggregation Platform. They should also be familiar with either Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer web browsers.

\subsection{Problem Reporting}
Issues will be reported via the issue tracker on http://github.com/codyaray/mashbot/issues and will be assigned to the proper development team from there.
\subsection{Progress Reporting}
Regressions and failures will be reported to the respective team lead when they are discovered. Successes are assumed and will not be further reported.
