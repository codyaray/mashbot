	\chapter{Abstract}
		A service that connects to a set of social APIs and provides a unified
		interface to push and pull data, using a plugin style architecture so
		that support for arbitrary services can be added without changing
		existing code.  This would be a core on which applications could be
		built.  For instance, the application we intend to build on top of
		this core is a tool for small and medium sized businesses to manage
		social networking campaigns. Features include scheduling publish dates
		for pieces of content, coordinated across services, as well as
		allowing multiple users to manage "official" accounts.  Metrics would
		also be generated, including information on clickthrough/conversion
		rates per link published, useful for tracking the success of a
		campaign.
