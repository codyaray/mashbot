\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose} % JK
This document is the general overview of the software requirements for
the Mashbot project. These requirements are directly related to the
functionality, performances, constraints, attributes, and interfaces
of the system.

Mashbot is a web service for managing a company's presence on social
networks. One goal of Mashbot is to unify the interfaces of a
multitude of social networks, allowing users to learn a standardized
interface and more easily cope with the flood of new social network
platforms. A second goal is to allow for a hands off approach to
social network marketing by allowing the scheduling of campaign events
to be distributed to social networks.
 
\subsection{Scope} % JK
This document contains the criteria by which the initial Mashbot
release will be judged. It is written for the developers, testers, and
end-users of Mashbot.
\subsection{Glossary} % Everyone

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Campaign} A collection of content that is scheduled to be
published
\item \textbf{External Service Account} An account on a social
  networking platform outside of Mashbot

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overview} % CR

Marketing, customer service, business overhead and development efforts
compete for resources in many startups and small
businesses. Furthermore, early stage startups often have small or
non-existent marketing budgets, especially in resource-hungry
product-based startups. Although the plethora of widely available and
affordable communications technology (e.g., social media, VoIP,
streaming video, etc.) theoretically reduces both capital and
operating expenditures related to marketing, the quantity of such
technologies and services effectively creates an "opportunity
overload" which makes the process of maintaining a focused and
effective marketing campaign more difficult. Furthermore, with the
number of services, technologies, and "specialists" arriving each day,
it is nearly impossible to keep up with all the trends, much less
fully take advantage of each one, or even monitor them all
adequately. The widespread adoption of communications technology is a
double-edged sword; there are many more avenues for marketing and
customer service, but it is much more difficult to effectively apply
reputation management strategies or adequate customer service through
all channels. This project proposes to build a tool to increase the
effectiveness and efficiency of marketing campaigns and customer
service for small to medium businesses.

\section{Overall Description}
     \subsection{Product Perspective} % CR

The initial focus will be on scheduled marketing campaigns utilizing
social media. However, this may expand to include customer service
functionality, management of more traditional campaigns such as
direct mail, trade shows and other events, or user-created campaign
classes.
 
The first objective is to develop and release a small open source
platform to provide a service agnostic facade API bundling common
operations in widely used services (e.g., Facebook, Flickr, Twitter,
Wordpress, or YouTube). This platform will provide a plugin-based
architecture for abstracting myriad services behind a single facade,
based upon content types provided in common data models. This
sub-project will not only be useful to the open source community but
will also devalue much of the competition whose prime added value
comes from providing such a service. Furthermore, it opens the
opportunity for the public to help maintain existing service plugins
as well as contribute plugins for new services. Finally, it leads to
the inclusion of both a dual licensing revenue model and a niche
software development service-based revenue model for custom extensions
and applications built upon this core, which is proven to be more
sustainable over time.
 
The first application of this core platform will be the campaign
manager referenced above.  While the exact feature set is to be
determined during the SCRUM design process, expected features include a
portal to existing services where messages can be "pushed", or
broadcast, through existing service channels. This portal will also
allow for the collection of responses from customers, fans, critics,
and other audiences from these same channels. Users will be able to
view social networking messages directed at them, as well as perform
data mining tasks on the social networks to provide more intelligent
heuristics regarding brands' strength amongst particular markets. They
will also be allowed to schedule campaign events at certain times. For
example, users will be able to prepare a press release far in advance
of its distribution, or queue a number of updates to be spread out
over a certain time period.

\subsubsection{System Interfaces} % VS
Mashbot combines several components to provide required functionality.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Authentication} Mashbot will allow the use of external
  authentication modules for user login. Mashbot will also provide an
  internal authentication mechanism in case an external module is
  unavailable.
\item \textbf{Campaign Manager Web Client} Mashbot has an interface
  for a web client which processes user commands to interact with
  campaigns.
\item \textbf{Publishing and Aggregation Platform} Mashbot has an
  interface for publishing content to social networks, as well as for
  aggregating social network data.
\item \textbf{Database} Mashbot has an interface to a database which
  allows for the storage and retrieval of data related to accounts and
  campaigns.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{User Interface} % JK
The user interface consists of a web front end with tabs to separate
the various workflow areas. To create content, the user is provided
with a calendar scheduling tool and a content editor.  Additionally,
there is a monitoring dashboard which gives the user a view on
responses to the content in any given campaign.  Finally, there is an
explore view that gives the user a portal with which they can keep
tabs on topics of interest in social media.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces} % VS
The Mashbot web client runs on any computer hardware meeting the
following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Capable of connecting to the Internet
\item Capable of running a modern HTTP 1.1 web browser
\item Includes a keyboard and a pointing device
\item Includes writable volatile storage
\end{itemize}
The Mashbot server runs on any computer hardware meeting
the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Capable of connecting to the Internet as a server.
\item Capable of interfacing with modern database software.
\item Capable of running a modern suite of networking software.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces} % VS
The Mashbot software integrates some external software to provide
functionality.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Authentication} Mashbot authenticates users against it's
  internal user database.
\item \textbf{Campaign Manager Web Client} Mashbot interfaces with the
  userâ€™s web browser and expects that it is capable of HTTP 1.1 and
  HTML 4.0.
\item \textbf{Database} Mashbot software interfaces with an existing
  database software.
\item \textbf{Publishing and Aggregation Platform}
\item \textbf{Server} The Mashbot server runs on an operating system
  that supports serving dynamic web pages using encryption and is
  capable of communicating with the Internet.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces} % VS
Communication between the web client and the server software is
facilitated by common network protocols. This allows compatibility
with the majority of our user's machines.  Data will be encrypted
using TLS and HTTP/1.1. The use of these protocols requires the
ability for the systems to communicate using TCP/IP network stacks.
The Mashbot system sends emails using SMTP.

\subsubsection{Memory Constraints} % VS
The Mashbot server requires no greater than 1 gigabyte of RAM
memory. The web client requires no more than the minimum memory a
modern desktop computer commonly has, approximately 256 megabytes of
RAM.

\subsection{Product Functions} % AG
Mashbot should be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Schedule content for various services to be published
  concurrently
\item View and Compare historical metrics of campaigns
\item View/Create replies to content
\item Maintain users and approvers of content
\item Set up keyword alerts for ``watched'' services
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{User Characteristics} % AG
The target user is a small to medium business employee who understands
the basic capabilities of social media.

\subsection{Requirements Apportioning} % VS
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{4in}|}
  \hline \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline \hline 1 &
  Mashbot can not be released unless it satisfies these
  requirements. \\ \hline 2 & Mashbot may be initially released
  without satisfying these requirements. Having these requirements
  unfulfilled must not create dangers to the system. They should be
  implemented in the next minor release. \\ \hline 3 & These
  requirements are not expected to be fulfilled by the initial release
  of Mashbot, but should be implemented in the next major
  release. \\ \hline 4 & These requirements are outside the current
  scope of the project, but are included to exhibit how our software
  will improve in the future. \\ \hline

\end{description}

\section{User Interface} % JK
The user interface will consist of a tabbed navigation bar that
unifies the sitewide navigation, as well as module specific navigation
as needed. Tabs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dashboard
\item Create
\item Schedule
\item Explore
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dashboard}
The dashboard consists of graphs and charts to give the user a quick
view on how their campaigns are performing.  Metrics include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clickthrough rate
\item Page Views
\item Number of Comments
\end{itemize}
Service plugins can define additional specialized metrics to track, as
well, for instance ``retweets'' for Twitter.  A panel is available to
give more information on each metric as it is selected. See Fig~\ref{dashboard}
\subsubsection{Create}
This view allows users to create campaigns and fill them with content.
This view is also used when users need to edit an existing
campaign. See Fig~\ref{create}
\paragraph{Add content}
A user can add content via the add content button near the top of the
view.  This will prompt the user to select the content type, which is
populated by the services the user currently has access to via
credentials stored in the system. This will create a section in the
main part of the view that allows the user to add individual elements
of that content type, each individually scheduled.  Each row line item
will allow the user to schedule, edit, or delete that content type.
\subsubsection{Schedule}
\paragraph{Scheduling content}
Users can drag items from the left hand bucket of content to the
calendar to schedule content.  The content will receive a default
golive time of 12am on the day the content is dragged to.  If the user
desires a different time, he may click the content in the schedule and
assign the proper time. See Fig~\ref{schedule}
\paragraph{Calendar}
The calendar allows the user to manage when content goes live, and
gives a visual representation of the actions taken on content.  It is
clear when content goes live and when (if) it is deleted.  The user
can page from month to month to schedule content to any day desired.
\subsubsection{Explore}
This view allows users to get a pulse on what information social media
contains.  This includes the ability to set up monitored searches for
services that support keyword search via api.  This also will
aggregate data gathered from comments on content that has been
published as part of a given campaign

\section{Preliminary Analysis} % JK
Mashbot is a data driven web application.  It aggregates data from
various web services.  This figure shows the flow of data through the
web application.  There is a core that handles all requests for
various data needed by the application.  Authentication information is
retrieved from the database and used to request content from services.
